# AI training thing
### This is an AI thing, which actually does not work that well.
## Idea
The idea was that you'll have a list of actions, that is randomised, and that you'll give a score, and mutate on.
## Is it a clean, clear project ?
# No
basically it is very messy because it is just my first ever try at SDL3

## What's next ?
* I am going to fix alot of issues
* add multiple generation saving
